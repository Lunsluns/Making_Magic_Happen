More MHRR gear - our logo and photos of adoptables can be found on lots of cool items. These are a little cheaper, and sometimes photo items are lesser quality than the Zazzle store.

       Whether temporary or until a rabbit gets a home, fostering helps in MANY ways. It helps socialize a rabbit and help him become friendlier (especially nervous bunnies who need an experienced rabbit person to figure them out!), as well as learn his likes & dislikes for his new family. It helps ease the burden at the main foster house, and the bunny can enjoy more one-on-one time and exercise! Not to mention fostered bunnies get adopted quickly for other reasons - foster families sometimes end up adopting or have friends & family who fall in love while visiting!

      Browse our Amazon wishlist and donate an item or two. While we accept food donations, we don't ask for them regularly as we are able to purchase hay & foods in bulk directly from Oxbow through their Rescue Rewards program for a much cheaper rate than it can be purchased locally or online to the public, so we'd rather see your donations go further!
