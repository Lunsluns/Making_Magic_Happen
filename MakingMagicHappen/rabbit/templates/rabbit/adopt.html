                         Our adoptables come from all walks of life - owners moving or no longer have time, kids lost interest, stray, or from the pound or other rescues that don't normally handle bunnies. All summer we seem to receive entire litters from people who were sold "two females."
                        <br>
                        These rabbits are kept in foster parent's homes. We often bring 5-8 rabbits to adoption days (see homepage calendar for dates and locations). If you'd like to visit with a specific rabbit or meet the gang to pick one out, just let us know and we'll do our best to have that rabbit at the next Adoption Day or Care Day.
                        <br>
                        Please have a look at our guys and gals that are looking for new homes, and don't forget to click each bunny or animal's name for more pictures and information.

                    We do not have a public shelter building to visit as all of our rabbits and guinea pigs are kept in foster homes, but we do adoption days at Petsmart typically every other weekend (see our calendar on the home page for dates and times). If adoption days aren't a good time for you, we can usually make an appointment for an alternate time with a volunteer. It's easier to get the ball rolling and make sure adoption day or your adoption appointment goes smoothly with the following steps:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each adopted bunny goes home with an adoption bag and packet which includes an adoption certificate, a measuring cup, and some pellets that your adopted pet has been eating to help with the transition to its new food. If your bunny has any specific toys or treats that they really like, we will send those also. Our adoption fees are typically $50/rabbit or $70/pair; the adoption fee for each rabbit is listed on their biography pages. This adoption fee does not include a cage or accessories unless mentioned specifically on that pet's biography page. We sometimes have cages for sale if you can't find a preferred one locally or don't want to buy online.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Please bring a pet carrier (lined with a towel or hay for traction) or cardboard box with holes to bring your new bunny home. Your bun's adoption fee can be paid by cash, check (made out to Magic Happens Rabbit Rescue), and most times we will have a credit card reader for smartphones at adoption days and care days, depending on which adoption counselors are there.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If the rabbit you are adopting is not already spayed or neutered, we will have it done prior to it going to its new home. We prefer to have the rabbits spayed or neutered with us so that we can observe their recovery and can bring the rabbit to a vet quickly if necessary. If the rabbit you are hoping to adopt is not yet altered, you may still come meet him or her and we can mark the adoptable as pending for you (after an adoption application is approved) until after the surgery is complete.
                    <br>   
                    <br>
                    It's important to have the majority if not all of the rabbit's home (cage and litterbox especially) lined up for your bun to explore once you get home. Stopping by the store for a quick accessory is OK, but you don't want to be caught without proper housing if the pet store on the way home doesn't have the right size cage or playpen available for sale. Our Ultimate Caresheet has a great list of needed and great-to-have items, and our Rabbit Care section has information on different styles of cages and how to build your own, even if you're not a hammer-and-nails kind of person.

                    <br>
                    In Dec 2017 we began switching from ear tattoos to microchips, so any intakes after that time will have a HomeAgain microchip.

                    <br>
                    Microchips are placed over the shoulders, and are about the size of a grain of rice. Should your bunny escape the play yard or get away during travel, it is vital to have your information already associated with its microchip number. Enrollment is only $10.99, and helps MHRR get another microchip for the next bunny that comes in to our program!

               * You provide shelter, feeding, and general care in your home for as long as you are able OR until the rabbit(s) find a permanent home.
        * The rabbit will need at least an hour of exercise time (out of the cage) each day in a rabbit-proofed area of your home (ex: a kitchen or hallway with blocked-off exits that has no electrical cords or other dangers that the rabbit can reach).
        * Keep MHRR updated with any personality, behavior, or health changes. A quick e-mail or phone call once a week with an update is sufficient.
        * Be available to bring the fostered rabbit to adoption days when requested or back to the main house to meet with potential adopters (unless you are fostering as a test-run to adopt). This is done by appointment and will be arranged with your schedule in mind.
        
        MHRR will provide any medical care the rabbit might need (including neutering and spaying) before going into foster care. If additional care is needed, please contact MHRR first!

        <p>Yes! As long as the rabbit you want is not already in a foster home or not yet spayed or neutered, you can take whichever rabbit you prefer. If you aren't sure which one you might like, you may come to the main house and meet them before you choose. Of course we can help you decide based on your schedule and space available, as well as previous rabbit-keeping experience and personality-type desired. Be aware that if you choose a particularly cute or very sweet rabbit, it may not be long before it finds a potential home, and you may be asked to bring it to adoption day often. :)</p>

        <p>Probably not. Many rabbits get along great with cats and gentle dogs. Rabbits and cats typically do not bother one another, though sometimes the rabbit will chase the cat or ask it to groom him or her! If your dog is fine with a cat, he or she will likely be fine with a rabbit that is not afraid of dogs. You will need to use your best judgment about introducing two animals, and be able to keep the rabbit in a room isolated and safe from taunting or attack by other household pets if need be. If you have another pet rabbit, we recommend not housing them together as we wouldn't want to separate a bonded pair.</p>

                    If you are new to rabbit-keeping and aren't sure if you're ready for a long-term adoption commitment, or perhaps you would like to adopt a bunny friend for your current rabbit? Either way, foster-to-adopt is the way to go. It gives you a “trial run” with guidance from the group.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1.	Fill out a foster-to-adopt application - you can download it and email it in or bring to an adoption event, or fill it out online. If you need to borrow a cage and supplies for temporary housing, please let us know when you submit the application. We don't regularly bring cages & supplies to adoption days, but will if we are expecting your needs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2.	If you are looking to pair your rabbit with one of our adoptables, we recommend doing some “speed dates.” Not only does meeting on a neutral ground give us an idea of how the bonding process may go, but if there is immediate fighting on neutral ground, adoption as a bonded mate is unlikely.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3.	We will hold a check or cash for the amount of the adoption fee until we either hear from you that you would definitely like to adopt, or if the rabbit is returned we will return your check or cash to you. If you borrowed a cage and supplies, they will need to be returned if you decide to adopt the rabbit. If you would like to purchase the cage and supplies, let us know as some cages can be sold.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4.	You MUST give us an update once a week to let us know how things are going and your intended plans. We encourage you to call or email us with questions at any time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5.	While there is no set time frame, we would appreciate having a yes or no answer within a month.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A Care Day is the best time to bring a rabbit for a speed date or pick up a bunny that needs a cage and supplies to go home. Care Days are held every other Sunday (dates posted on the homepage), and are held at the Director’s home. If you are looking for a friend for your bunny, you will have the most to pick from at this time. If you cannot make it to a Care Day, we can sometimes make appointments during other times, depending on your location and the volunteer closest to you. If you are looking for a specific rabbit, please make sure we know in advance, as our fosters are spread throughout the state.

                    <h2>Personality:</h2> 
                        <br>
                        Rabbits are very cat-like when it comes to their temperament. They are typically independent, may know their name but don’t always come when called (except when they hear that treat bag!), and like attention on their terms, not yours. Of course, just like cats, every rabbit is different. Some are attention hogs, while others would be just as happy if you never petted them. One of the benefits from adopting a rabbit is that usually the rescue already knows its personality, so you don’t have to hope that pet store baby grows up to be a cuddler. They also are curious yet skittish. Their curiosity usually gets the better of them, but it may take them a while to get used to certain sounds or something new in their environment once they’ve settled in. The people who say that rabbits don’t have personality are often those that never interact with their rabbit or let it out of its cage… a bunny can’t really show you its personality if its left outside in a hutch away from the family and is only visited for a minute or two each day. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Behavior:</h2>
                        <br>
                        Rabbits do three things well: chew, poop, and reproduce. Rabbits and rodents have open-rooted teeth, meaning they grow constantly throughout their entire lives. If a rabbit doesn’t have hay or toys to munch on, they’ll start to chew on other things, such as their cage bars, litterbox, or items in the home – they love baseboards and electrical cords! In the wild a rabbit is always on the move, so their digestive tract isn’t designed to have them sit around and eat big meals, but rather nibble on the go. This is why having timothy hay around for all day nibbling is important. You may also notice your rabbit digging in its litterbox or tossing its food bowl. If your bun likes to dig, you can provide it a shoebox of newspaper, or if he’s a tosser, a little plastic cup can be a lot of fun (just be sure to check for ingesting the plastic!). Your rabbit will also want to claim things, but thankfully they usually “chin” things to mark instead of spraying, just like a cat. A rabbit that is spayed or neutered is less likely to constantly want to mark things, and far less likely to spray. They are also more inclined to use a litterbox on a regular basis. This makes cleanup much easier, and you can let your bunny roam around a larger bunny-proofed area! When you first bring a bunny home or let it out into a new area, he or she is likely to put a few poops here and there, and the next time they are let out, they will go back to check to see if any other animal has “re-marked” its territory. If not, then they are unlikely to leave more poop pills behind. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Bunny Chores:</h2>
                        <br>
                        On a daily basis, you’ll need to provide pellets, timothy hay, and fresh water. Scooping the litterbox (if your bun uses one) should be done daily, or a few times a week at the least. Cage cleaning should be done weekly or every other week – take out all the bedding, sanitize the litterbox, food bowls, etc. using Dawn dishsoap or a half-water/half-vinegar solution. Every week or two week you’ll want to examine your rabbit. Look for matts starting in his or her armpits and tail/belly area, and inspect the nails to see if they need trimming. If your bunny does have matts, use a matt comb or have an adult cut it out carefully. You’ll also want to check the teeth for even wear, the ears for crusts (a sign of ear mites), and the scent glands if it’s a little stinky. A weekly brushing gives you this opportunity to feel your bunny all over to find any suspicious lumps or bumps as well as bond with your bunny.

                       <h2> The Best Part: </h2> 
                        <br>
                        Owning a bunny takes just as much work as a dog or cat, but just in a different way. They still need to see a vet every year for a physical, but they don’t need vaccinations. Rabbits live up to 10 years or more, so plan on having a rabbit as a family pet for its lifetime. Just like any other pet, bunnies don’t deserve to be bounced from home to home because a family doesn’t want to make time for them anymore. Rabbits are a big responsibility for their entire lifetime, but also are very rewarding. They go crazy when they hear the treat bag crinkle, they do zig-zags and funny hops when they get excited about getting let out of the cage, and they are the cutest home decoration you can find. Once you bond with a rabbit, you’ll find there’s no other rabbit like yours.                  </div>

                            I know that rabbits can live up to 12 years or more and am ready to care for it for its lifetime.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I will dedicate the time to give fresh food and water daily, clean the habitat weekly at minimum, and give it playtime outside of its cage multiple times each week.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have the space to put a cage or habitat large enough to comfortably house a rabbit, and a safe area where it can run and play in addition to its habitat.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have the finances to purchase its necessities, such as its food, litter, and veterinary costs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I respect that it is not the rabbit's nature to be held or tolerate being picked up and off the ground. Rabbits can become accustomed to these things for brief periods, but I am okay if it never accepts these activities that are outside its nature.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have the patience to live with an animal that likes to chew and dig, and may or may not litter train or ever become fully "housebroken."
                            <br>
                            If this rabbit is for my children, I am aware that my children may lose interest in taking responsibility of the rabbit and that, as the parent, I am ultimately responsible for the rabbit should my children not take proper care of the pet.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                           If you've answered yes to all of the above, then you are ready for the next step! Rabbit care, like any animal, is more than just changing food and water. Rabbits are unique in both features and personality and even in body language and how they communicate (did you know that offering your hand low under their nose is a very dominant move, whereas it's a submissive move to a dog?). Reading up on rabbit care will be very rewarding for both you and your rabbit - both of you will be much happier and far less frustrated! Head over to our Rabbit Care page for lots more information.

                                We consider that few classroom environments can meet the many needs of rabbits as a home environment could. If you are considering a classroom rabbit, we hope we can convince you that it might not be a good idea. If you already have a classroom rabbit, we would like to help you improve the life of your classroom rabbit or one you know. All it takes are commitment to the rabbit’s well-being and accurate information about his or her needs.

                                    If their personalities are not stunted by boredom or abuse, they commonly display affection, anger, jealousy, delight, annoyance, fear, submissiveness, grief, dominance, guile, contentment, mischievousness, curiosity, sadness, and joy. Even when neutered and spayed, pairs will affectionately snuggle and groom each other, and engage in sexual activity. They commonly enjoy playing with toys, especially those that can be chewed, tossed, pushed, or hidden under.

                                Rabbit “language” includes tooth-clicking, tail-wagging, dancing, charging, bowing, nudging, ear signals, licking, honking, and growling. They quickly learn what the word “No!” means. Many learn to respond to their names. Others, like cats, know their names but choose not to respond. Some can be taught to respond to other voice commands, such as “Give me a kiss” or “Go to your cage!”

                               <br>

                               Breeding a classroom rabbit so that children can experience the birth and development of the young is a common practice. However, rabbit births are rarely witnessed because they occur quickly, and usually at night.More importantly, classroom breeding too often results in bunnies who suffer and die from improper care. Some highly stressed rabbit mothers or fathers will cannibalize the young. Witnessing such an event can be traumatic to young children. If the bunnies survive to maturity, they often become maginalized pets in backyard hutches. Others are killed outright, abandoned outdoors, or taken to a municipal shelter, where they stand a good chance of euthanasia, even if they are healthy and friendly.We believe that interest in animal life and humane behavior toward animals can be better reinforced by quality interaction with a healthy, happy rabbit or other pet.

                                Swatting, or rubbing a rabbit’s nose in the “accident,” only frightens and confuses her. Some rabbits seem to take to the litter box naturally, while others require your patience and time to learn. MHRR can provide tips on encouraging the litter box habit.

                                <br>
                                Spaying and neutering do more than prevent baby bunnies. Spaying and neutering by a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care improves health, personality, litter box habits, and the ability to get along with other rabbits. Usually, feces and urine odors are greatly reduced by the reduction in hormone production, and the instinct to spray urine is eliminated. Overall, adult rabbits tend to be more easily trainable, calmer, less prone to chewing and digging, and more people-oriented than young rabbits.

                                <br>
                                Sadly, many people’s perception of what rabbits are like is based on erroneous assumptions and experience with neglected classroom or backyard pets. It’s common to see rabbits sitting all day (and night) in small classroom cages. True, unlike many species, rabbits can endure such a life quietly for a surprisingly long time. But rabbits need exercise and stimulation to maintain health, good spirits, and normal behavior. A constantly caged rabbit becomes withdrawn and aggressive, resulting in symptoms such as lethargy, unresponsiveness, obesity, or neurotic behaviors.Within a few years, most rabbits confined in such a setting become ill and die. That’s not a normal life span. With proper care, domestic rabbits can live 8-12 years or longer. If no one makes a significant investment of time, attention, and care of a classroom rabbit, the result is a withdrawn animal who does not have much to give back to the students. Regardless of what teachers or parents believe about the care of a classroom animal, what do such practices show students about the value of living beings? Shelters are overflowing because of the common perception of animals as objects to be passed around, cared for only when it’s convenient for people to do so, then abandoned when they become too much of a bother.
                    
                                <br>
                                On the other hand, a classroom rabbit can help children learn to be responsible pet owners. Your students can learn valuable lessons from interacting with a rabbit (or neutered pair) who run free among them:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                   Animals have individual personalities and preferences.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                Animal languages are different from one another.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                
                                Each animal species requires different behaviors on the part of humans who want to befriend them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                What a dog may regard as a playful overture may be regarded very differently by a rabbit.
                                <br>
                            <br>
                               <h3> Responsible pet ownership means meeting the animal’s needs, even when it’s inconvenient.</h3> 
                               <br>
                               <br>
                               Cleaning, training, grooming, and “bunny-proofing” are time consuming, but they are part of the commitment a pet owner should make.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            <h2> Questions to ask yourself before getting a classroom rabbit</h2>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                Are you committed to caring for a rabbit as your pet for 8-12 years?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Are you fully committed to giving the rabbit consistent, on-schedule, care? </h3>
                                <br>
                                Because of the way rabbit digestion works, food, hay, and water must be available at all times. Cages and litterboxes should be cleaned daily of soiled matter and must be thoroughly scrubbed weekly.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <h3> How will you ensure that the rabbit receives proper care when you are not around? </h3>
                                <br>
                                <br>    
                                    Rabbits need consistent care, including on weekends and during vacations. Sending a classroom rabbit home with a student or a succession of students can result in severe stress to the animal. Improper care is likely, even in the most well-intentioned families. Being left at school has its risks. Many teachers have returned to school on Monday only to find a dead animal in the cage that housed an apparently healthy one on Friday.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <h3>Are you willing to monitor your rabbit closely for illness?</h3> 
                                <br>
                                Rabbits need the care of someone who can quickly recognize small changes in behavior, eating, and droppings. These are the first symptoms of illness, which can progress quickly in these small creatures.
                              <br>
                                <h3> If your rabbit is sick, can you afford to have him treated?</h3> 
                               <br>
                                It can be difficult to find veterinarians who are knowledgeable about treating rabbits. If you make a vet visit and medication or other care is prescribed, are you prepared to give it?
                              
                                Do you have space for a 2-foot by 3-foot cage, both at school and at home?

                                Who will foot the bill for a humanely sized cage?

                                What would happen if the air conditioning or heat at your school is turned off outside of school hours, or if pesticides are sprayed?
                                Rabbits, because of their thick coats, begin to show distress at temperatures above 85° F. Rabbits are so sensitive to pesticides that even common flea preparations are likely to cause serious illness.
                                
                                Are your students mature enough to understand the lessons you want them to learn from the rabbit and are they capable of treating the rabbit appropriately?
                                
                                Children under 7 are usually not mature enough to safely interact with a rabbit except under close, constant, supervision.
                              
                                Do you have the time to teach students proper behavior and to monitor their interaction with the rabbit? 
                                
                                Adults must be committed to teaching and enforcing rules that protect both the child and the rabbit from physical and emotional trauma.
                              
                                What will you do if a child is injured by the rabbit or vice versa?
                                
                                Young children love to pick up and cuddle animals. However, most rabbits feel safe only with four feet on the floor or other stable surface. Spinal injuries and dislocated or broken legs are common when rabbits struggle or fall when small children try to hold them. Children can also be badly scratched or painfully bitten by a frightened rabbit as she tries to escape.
                                
                                Are you willing to “bunny-proof” your classroom so you can allow the rabbit the out-of-cage time necessary for his well-being? 
                                
                                Rabbits like to chew and dig, but their destructiveness can be managed by managing their environment, training, and other methods. Rabbits should get at least three hours of exercise daily.
                                
                                Are you willing to groom your rabbit like he or she needs to stay healthy?
                                
                                This includes trimming nails, brushing (especially for angoras), cleaning scent glands and more.
                               
                                Is your classroom comfortable for a naturally timid animal? 
                                
                                Stresses present in classrooms include noise, over-handling, improper foods and diet variations, disruption of routine, temperature changes, and loneliness.
                               
                                Does your principal approve of uncaged pets? 
                                
                                If not, are you willing to take the rabbit home?
                               
                                Will you be prepared to take the rabbit home and keep her there if a student is allergic to her?
                               
                                We hope these considerations will help you decide whether a classroom rabbit is really appropriate as well as enhance any existing classroom rabbit’s life.
