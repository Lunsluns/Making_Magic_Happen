                         Our adoptables come from all walks of life - owners moving or no longer have time, kids lost interest, stray, or from the pound or other rescues that don't normally handle bunnies. All summer we seem to receive entire litters from people who were sold "two females."
                        <br>
                        These rabbits are kept in foster parent's homes. We often bring 5-8 rabbits to adoption days (see homepage calendar for dates and locations). If you'd like to visit with a specific rabbit or meet the gang to pick one out, just let us know and we'll do our best to have that rabbit at the next Adoption Day or Care Day.
                        <br>
                        Please have a look at our guys and gals that are looking for new homes, and don't forget to click each bunny or animal's name for more pictures and information.

                    We do not have a public shelter building to visit as all of our rabbits and guinea pigs are kept in foster homes, but we do adoption days at Petsmart typically every other weekend (see our calendar on the home page for dates and times). If adoption days aren't a good time for you, we can usually make an appointment for an alternate time with a volunteer. It's easier to get the ball rolling and make sure adoption day or your adoption appointment goes smoothly with the following steps:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each adopted bunny goes home with an adoption bag and packet which includes an adoption certificate, a measuring cup, and some pellets that your adopted pet has been eating to help with the transition to its new food. If your bunny has any specific toys or treats that they really like, we will send those also. Our adoption fees are typically $50/rabbit or $70/pair; the adoption fee for each rabbit is listed on their biography pages. This adoption fee does not include a cage or accessories unless mentioned specifically on that pet's biography page. We sometimes have cages for sale if you can't find a preferred one locally or don't want to buy online.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Please bring a pet carrier (lined with a towel or hay for traction) or cardboard box with holes to bring your new bunny home. Your bun's adoption fee can be paid by cash, check (made out to Magic Happens Rabbit Rescue), and most times we will have a credit card reader for smartphones at adoption days and care days, depending on which adoption counselors are there.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If the rabbit you are adopting is not already spayed or neutered, we will have it done prior to it going to its new home. We prefer to have the rabbits spayed or neutered with us so that we can observe their recovery and can bring the rabbit to a vet quickly if necessary. If the rabbit you are hoping to adopt is not yet altered, you may still come meet him or her and we can mark the adoptable as pending for you (after an adoption application is approved) until after the surgery is complete.
                    <br>   
                    <br>
                    It's important to have the majority if not all of the rabbit's home (cage and litterbox especially) lined up for your bun to explore once you get home. Stopping by the store for a quick accessory is OK, but you don't want to be caught without proper housing if the pet store on the way home doesn't have the right size cage or playpen available for sale. Our Ultimate Caresheet has a great list of needed and great-to-have items, and our Rabbit Care section has information on different styles of cages and how to build your own, even if you're not a hammer-and-nails kind of person.

                    <br>
                    In Dec 2017 we began switching from ear tattoos to microchips, so any intakes after that time will have a HomeAgain microchip.

                    <br>
                    Microchips are placed over the shoulders, and are about the size of a grain of rice. Should your bunny escape the play yard or get away during travel, it is vital to have your information already associated with its microchip number. Enrollment is only $10.99, and helps MHRR get another microchip for the next bunny that comes in to our program!

               * You provide shelter, feeding, and general care in your home for as long as you are able OR until the rabbit(s) find a permanent home.
        * The rabbit will need at least an hour of exercise time (out of the cage) each day in a rabbit-proofed area of your home (ex: a kitchen or hallway with blocked-off exits that has no electrical cords or other dangers that the rabbit can reach).
        * Keep MHRR updated with any personality, behavior, or health changes. A quick e-mail or phone call once a week with an update is sufficient.
        * Be available to bring the fostered rabbit to adoption days when requested or back to the main house to meet with potential adopters (unless you are fostering as a test-run to adopt). This is done by appointment and will be arranged with your schedule in mind.
        
        MHRR will provide any medical care the rabbit might need (including neutering and spaying) before going into foster care. If additional care is needed, please contact MHRR first!

        <p>Yes! As long as the rabbit you want is not already in a foster home or not yet spayed or neutered, you can take whichever rabbit you prefer. If you aren't sure which one you might like, you may come to the main house and meet them before you choose. Of course we can help you decide based on your schedule and space available, as well as previous rabbit-keeping experience and personality-type desired. Be aware that if you choose a particularly cute or very sweet rabbit, it may not be long before it finds a potential home, and you may be asked to bring it to adoption day often. :)</p>

        <p>Probably not. Many rabbits get along great with cats and gentle dogs. Rabbits and cats typically do not bother one another, though sometimes the rabbit will chase the cat or ask it to groom him or her! If your dog is fine with a cat, he or she will likely be fine with a rabbit that is not afraid of dogs. You will need to use your best judgment about introducing two animals, and be able to keep the rabbit in a room isolated and safe from taunting or attack by other household pets if need be. If you have another pet rabbit, we recommend not housing them together as we wouldn't want to separate a bonded pair.</p>

                    <h2>Personality:</h2> 
                        <br>
                        Rabbits are very cat-like when it comes to their temperament. They are typically independent, may know their name but don’t always come when called (except when they hear that treat bag!), and like attention on their terms, not yours. Of course, just like cats, every rabbit is different. Some are attention hogs, while others would be just as happy if you never petted them. One of the benefits from adopting a rabbit is that usually the rescue already knows its personality, so you don’t have to hope that pet store baby grows up to be a cuddler. They also are curious yet skittish. Their curiosity usually gets the better of them, but it may take them a while to get used to certain sounds or something new in their environment once they’ve settled in. The people who say that rabbits don’t have personality are often those that never interact with their rabbit or let it out of its cage… a bunny can’t really show you its personality if its left outside in a hutch away from the family and is only visited for a minute or two each day.

                        <h2>Behavior:</h2>
                        <br>
                        Rabbits do three things well: chew, poop, and reproduce. Rabbits and rodents have open-rooted teeth, meaning they grow constantly throughout their entire lives. If a rabbit doesn’t have hay or toys to munch on, they’ll start to chew on other things, such as their cage bars, litterbox, or items in the home – they love baseboards and electrical cords! In the wild a rabbit is always on the move, so their digestive tract isn’t designed to have them sit around and eat big meals, but rather nibble on the go. This is why having timothy hay around for all day nibbling is important. You may also notice your rabbit digging in its litterbox or tossing its food bowl. If your bun likes to dig, you can provide it a shoebox of newspaper, or if he’s a tosser, a little plastic cup can be a lot of fun (just be sure to check for ingesting the plastic!). Your rabbit will also want to claim things, but thankfully they usually “chin” things to mark instead of spraying, just like a cat. A rabbit that is spayed or neutered is less likely to constantly want to mark things, and far less likely to spray. They are also more inclined to use a litterbox on a regular basis. This makes cleanup much easier, and you can let your bunny roam around a larger bunny-proofed area! When you first bring a bunny home or let it out into a new area, he or she is likely to put a few poops here and there, and the next time they are let out, they will go back to check to see if any other animal has “re-marked” its territory. If not, then they are unlikely to leave more poop pills behind.

                        <h2>Bunny Chores:</h2>
                        <br>
                        On a daily basis, you’ll need to provide pellets, timothy hay, and fresh water. Scooping the litterbox (if your bun uses one) should be done daily, or a few times a week at the least. Cage cleaning should be done weekly or every other week – take out all the bedding, sanitize the litterbox, food bowls, etc. using Dawn dishsoap or a half-water/half-vinegar solution. Every week or two week you’ll want to examine your rabbit. Look for matts starting in his or her armpits and tail/belly area, and inspect the nails to see if they need trimming. If your bunny does have matts, use a matt comb or have an adult cut it out carefully. You’ll also want to check the teeth for even wear, the ears for crusts (a sign of ear mites), and the scent glands if it’s a little stinky. A weekly brushing gives you this opportunity to feel your bunny all over to find any suspicious lumps or bumps as well as bond with your bunny.

                       <h2> The Best Part: </h2> 
                        <br>
                        Owning a bunny takes just as much work as a dog or cat, but just in a different way. They still need to see a vet every year for a physical, but they don’t need vaccinations. Rabbits live up to 10 years or more, so plan on having a rabbit as a family pet for its lifetime. Just like any other pet, bunnies don’t deserve to be bounced from home to home because a family doesn’t want to make time for them anymore. Rabbits are a big responsibility for their entire lifetime, but also are very rewarding. They go crazy when they hear the treat bag crinkle, they do zig-zags and funny hops when they get excited about getting let out of the cage, and they are the cutest home decoration you can find. Once you bond with a rabbit, you’ll find there’s no other rabbit like yours.                  </div>
